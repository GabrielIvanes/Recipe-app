# Recipe-app

Recipe app made in HTML / CSS / JS with the API https://www.themealdb.com/api.php. 

You can search for recipes. As soon as you write in the input, an auto-completion will help you. If several recipes are returned, pressing the enter key will put the first returned recipe in the input. Pressing the random recipe button allows you to get a random recipe directly. You can add 1 filter at a time on the main ingredient, on the category of the recipe or on the country of the recipe. As soon as a filter is chosen, you will have an auto-completion of all the recipes with this filter. Writing in the input will not help when a filter is chosen. If you lose the auto-completion when you have a filter activated, no problem, just click again on the same filter or just write a random letter in the input.
